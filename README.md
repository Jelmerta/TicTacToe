This Tictactoe app has a title screen where you can press a button to start the game.
Both the title screen and the game activity have (the same) setting it can change - It can toggle the AI.
When AI is on, a random move is generated and used after the human did a move. Otherwise, two humans can play this game.
There is a restart button you can click whenever you want to start over.
